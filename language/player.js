	//var text = "I woke up at about 10:30 in the morning, which is around when I usually wake up. I work at home. I do freelance writing and editing so I make my own schedule for the most part. I made coffee, said hello to the cats, got back in bed with my laptop and my coffee, read my e-mail first, went and looked at the paper, looked at Facebook, read a few climate blogs which I’m addicted to. I’ve been very depressed over the last two years and something about reading about how the world is going to end is comforting when you’re depressed. It’s like nobody else seems to get it, but in ten years, when the Arctic ice is completely gone and the sea has been heated up another ten degrees, then the temperature is gonna go go up really fast, and people are gonna be really surprised, and they just don’t get it. That’s what I think anyway. I don’t understand people who have children and don’t see that as part of the future for their kids.  I probably talked to my husband but I don’t know what I said. He works at home too. My mother called and I asked her about her recent trip to Death Valley and she was very excited about how beautiful it was and how kind my sister who went with her was to pay for everything, she repeated several times. And I asked her about seeing my step-daughter, Rebecca, and she was kind of short about that, which I was kind of upset about because I wanted to hear her say something like ‘Oh, she looks wonderful and she was so charming.’ But that’s my mother. That’s the way she is. I had a meeting at the Museum of the City of New York. I took the subway uptown and got off at 96th Street. I walked west through a neighborhood where an old boyfriend of mine had an apartment. My husband and I separated for ten years starting in 2002 until last summer. I had this long relationship with a married man who at one point left his wife and got an apartment on the Upper East Side. And it was this kind of wonderful period in my relationship with him because he’d left his wife and we could be together. I feel a kind of nostalgia and a grief because he dumped me and I still haven’t really gotten over that. I was having a lot of memories of being taken out to Maison de Chocolat and a couple of little Italian places where’d we go for breakfast, and feeling kind of sad and deprived of certain pleasures that I used to have. On that day, I was feeling some of the pain of the loss but I kind of put it out of my mind so I was focusing more on the pleasant memories of being in that neighborhood. I walked in the lobby of the museum. The current exhibit now is on micro-apartments for the future, like 325 square feet or less. The woman who works there came down and took us upstairs to where the meeting was gonna take place. I thought I was gonna be there as an observer more than anything else, but they wanted to know what my idea was for the article. I said I was thinking of using the history of Harlem, from Revolutionary War time to the Harlem Renaissance up until now, and they all seemed to think that was a wonderful idea. I asked them if they thought 1500 words was a good length and none of them had any clue what that meant. So the meeting came to an end around six. I decided to walk up to Cathedral where there was an event that I’d told my friend, Lisa, I would go to. She’s in charge of scheduling events. We’d had a problem a couple weeks ago with work and friendship. I work for the Cathedral. I write the newsletter and write up grants, so I thought it politically would be a good thing to say yes. I stopped off for a piece of cake at the Hungarian pastry shop on the way to the Cathedral because I was hungry and didn’t have a chance to eat. I went into the Cathedral, went to the ladies’ room. I noticed I had this big stain on my shirt and they don’t have any paper towels or anything but those drying machine thingies so I was really annoyed. So I went back out and complained about that. The event started at that point. This event was an interview with Lorna Byrne. She’s seen angels and spoken to them her whole life. She went on about angels, how she could see them right as she was sitting there. There were dozens of them lining the walls of the Cathedral. They were wearing red today, perhaps in honor of the new Pope. They were all smiling and happy. She said I can even see there are two angels in the back of the Cathedral, they’re waving American flags. I thought this isn’t the right audience for that. We’re New Yorkers. We think that’s kind of yucky. Still, there was a little part of me that started to want to believe. And so I couldn’t help looking around even though I knew I wasn’t gonna see any angels and I didn’t. But I had this moment where I thought ‘Maybe things are completely different than I think. Maybe there really are all these angels in here. What if I believe?’ Then I came back to ‘Yeah, but I still wouldn’t be able to back this up with anything that I’ve ever experienced’ so I decided I wasn’t gonna go home and believe. So the event was over, and by then 600 people there immediately formed a line to receive a blessing because she had offered everyone a blessing. And Lisa said to me, I’m gonna have to wait around until these people leave. I went to the restaurant where I was gonna meet Lisa and told the hostess there was gonna be two of us. It was about 10:30 by then. I sat down at the table and I didn’t want to order wine because wine doesn’t really agree with me late at night but I was sitting alone and bored so I did. And it wasn’t very good. I was nervous about talking to Lisa because we’d had a terrible work problem where she’d told me the previous newsletter was just not good enough and I got stuff in too late and she said this in front of two younger people at a meeting and humiliated me and I was angry about it. We’ve been friends for 30 years, and I was anxious because I really need this job. I know she’s not gonna fire me but I don’t want to take advantage of our friendship. The whole thing is just very emotionally confusing so I was drinking the wine and trying to get in the proper frame of mind. She showed up and we ordered soup and pasta. We started talking about the work problem and we were both tiptoeing around the question. I said I think our communications problems are a result of you being so stressed out last fall because of your promotion. She obviously didn’t think that was the case but she didn’t want to challenge me too much. She wanted to soften things. She offered to pay for dinner which I was glad of and thanked her for. We paid, we left, we went home. My husband and my three cats were waiting in the apartment. I’m involved in this clinical trial where I wear a sort of light mask which is supposed to improve the skin. It’s white, it’s made of  plastic, doesn’t have eye holes or anything and inside there are these little glasses so the red light that shines inside the mask doesn’t get in your eyes. It’s infrared light, it doesn’t have any heat. I wear it for fifteen minutes a night. The idea is that it makes your skin look younger and smoother and more radiant. I think it’s working a little bit. My husband sat in the chair in the living room and he was joking with the cats: ‘Look at your mother. What do you think that is on her face? Does she look like a monster?’ Then I brushed my teeth, got into bed, and read a bunch of stuff on the internet. I went to bed at 3."

	// sam long past
	//var text = "This happened on what I believe to be a Thursday. So I woke up at 9:30. I had a small yogurt cup which I’ve been tending to have for the last month for breakfast. I’m still kind of broke and lead like a semi-bohemian lifestyle, dumpster diving for most of my food in Brooklyn Heights and various upscale neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn. Then I packed up my stuff and went. It was pickup game happening in McCarren Park where I typically play pickup games of soccer. I still don’t have a backpack because I left it on the subway a week prior, which I really regret, so I have to load my cleats and my soccer into a random bag that I wrap around my bike and hope that it doesn’t disintegrate and fall apart. This day was a really bad drizzle, a really cold, dark day but I had been watching lots of World Cup qualifying games prior so I was so amped up to play. So I got on my bike. It takes me about a half hour to get there. When I got there, I locked up my bike. I saw about six people gathered in the middle of the park in the freezing cold, and I was like ‘Cool. I might actually get to play today. I’m still a beginner because I was in a bad car accident like four years ago so soccer is kind of my way of rehabilitating. I was hit by an SUV four years ago in Baltimore, shattering the left side of my pelvis, pretty much completely and kind of ruining my life for about a year. So we start playing. I play defense because I’m not as good and it tends to be generally in pickup games, a hierarchy of talent, with strikers being the most because everybody wants to score a goal and then it declines from there to the goalie. So we play. I’m doing well. I’m not making huge mistakes but as the game progressed, I begin to mess up more and more. It starts pouring more and more. My body starts tensing up. I start not really having fun, but I keep playing. But you just can’t quit with these guys. So we play for two hours, and I don’t think anybody really wanted to play. No one wants to be the first person to admit they’re not having fun, so people keep playing until someone says it then eventually everyone’s like ‘OK. I’m ready to go.’ I’ve got to get more responsible when I start games, cuz like I said, I don’t have a backpack so I don’t pack up my stuff to the extent I should, so my jacket and my pants are laying on the open field completely soaked, like so so soaked. And my shoes were too. So I’m completely soaked. There’s nothing I can do about it. I have about an hour more of biking to do. I’m just gonna accept that I’m cold. I’ve been trying to be really tough recently. before I can go home, I need to go pick up money that I earned last week working for architect. The architect’s named Garrett and I helped him last week move his entire architecture shop from Gowanus all the way up to Greenpoint. I biked up Manhattan Avenue. Everyone was giving me really crazy looks. It’s kind of fun to bike when it’s cold out because people are always like ‘Why on Earth is this person biking? Why wouldn’t you just take the subway?’ I would’ve, but I was broke, and I don’t know, I love biking. I bike up Manhattan to the tip of Greenpoint. It was really beautiful. So I lock up my bike. I go up to the warehouse. I punched in the number for the building: that was 3125. I remember that because I always think of 31 25 year old ladies waving at me. I walked up the four flights of stairs, hit 3125 again. This is the floor where Garrett’s studio is located. I walk to the very back of it where I find Garrett’s studio. I was in a really good mood because I’m biking in the cold and I’d just played soccer. My friend, Hunter’s there working. And I’m like ‘Yo, Hunter, you want to hear a fun fact?’ and Hunter’s all about fun facts so he was like ‘I definitely do.’ So I start going off, telling him something. I share why we say cats and dogs and these old phrases and that’s because we used to have all the animals on the roof back in the day and they used to fall when it rained. At this point, I see Garrett getting upset because I’m distracting his worker, and eventually he’s like ‘Hey Sam, how you doing? How much do I owe you?’ And I was like ‘I actually filled out this time sheet’ and I got his timesheet. It was this piece of paper with weird drawings and crossed out numbers jotted on and some numbers are replaced with question marks. He hands me $200 in twenties. I walk out, I say goodbye to Hunter and take off. Heading back out the stairs, there was this other girl that worked last week. This girl was 33, moved back to New York from California where she was working on a weed farm. I think she was very interested in meeting guys because we had both confessed to looking through the classifieds on Craigslist when we were working. On the way out, she’s like ‘Hey, you want to smoke a cigarette outside?’ which is codeword for her rolling up a joint. So we went under the stairs and shared a joint. She had her iPad out and she kept playing random funk songs and being like ‘Oh, you should download this funk song.’ And I was like ‘OK. I will,’ but I never will. We’re just doing this conversation thing. Somebody dumped out a Tupperware of rice, like threw it. All of us a sudden, a big Tupperware of rice dropped down. So I’m waiting for her whirlwind of talking to die down so I can edge my way out of the conversation in a smooth and polite manner. Eventually, I’m like ‘Well, gotta go’ and I kind of jumped on my bike and took off. So I’m biking through Greenpoint. I’m trying to embrace the miserableness to a certain extent but I’m past the psychological possibility at this point. I’m cold and upset, and I’m dreaming about being warm. So I bike for a while. I go pick up an eighth of marijuana. I bike back. I get to my house. Our landlord refuses to fix the leaky roof. So I have to go take the trash out of the trash bin and move the trash bin to where the leaky roof is. Also, the toilet got clogged. I felt slightly defeated, like what kind of squalor are we living in? I eat two more yogurt cups. I pace around and smoke another cigarette. Eventually, I get this call from this girl I used to date. It was basically my biggest and kind of first relationship. We both collaborated, living together in the same room, running a theater collective and a venue together, basically sacrificing our own personal identities to become one person. We were very close and still maintain this very close relationship. It’s a lot easier for her because she’s a lot more capable of pursuing other people. I recently confessed to her that I’m still in love with her. This happened about three weeks ago. She had recently gone on a trip. She had met this guy at a party, like this really old, 45 year old guy. He had taken my ex-girlfriend to Costa Rica. Not Costa Rica, worse. Not worse. Puerto Rico. Worse in the sense of tourism. Like he had taken her to some stupid...stupid, stupid, it wasn’t stupid, I was just jealous, but it was pretty stupid. Like hotel in Puerto Rico. There’s this Facebook album that I was able to go through, semi-regretfully. She tells me that she’s not gonna see this guy, that it’s not anything serious. And I’m like ‘It kind of sucks for that guy because he probably thinks it is if he took you to Puerto Rico.’ We both come to the point that we know that we’ll never have a fully platonic relationship. The week before I moved to New York, we had sex again. Then we hooked up once again when I moved here. And this all happens under the influence of alcohol and it never ends up working out too well because it always ends up with her crying afterwards. Or there’s been times that we start hooking up and just the smell of us being that close evokes such an intense emotional response from her that she’ll start bawling, even if we’re making out. So we keep talking and there’s video project we’ll be doing. It’s a very sensitive subject too, talking about this project because in my opinion, talking about this video project is our way of testing out the waters if it would be possible for us to date again, trying to see if we’re able to work again, because what happened, at the end of our relationship, we couldn’t make art together anymore. We would just fight and fight. So dancing around this new media project is this guinea pig. At this point, it’s about six o’clock and I’m like ‘I have to go. I’m playing this show later.’ ‘Love you.’ ‘Love you.’ We get off the phone. So I’m kind of stressed, I smoke a joint. I go to the taco truck. I get an al pastor burrito. I pick up two tall boys of Yuengling. I also decide, because I got paid, I was kind of balling in the money a little bit, obviously with my al pastor burrito, and I decided to get a little half pint of whiskey. I head back to the house. We’re partying. It’s getting to be about ten o’clock. Eventually, this girl calls us and she’s like ‘We really need you to get to the venue,’ so we’re rushing out the door. We walk past this drug store, Dune Reade. It’s closed but for some reason, they’ve decided to project green rave dot lighting all over the front. We stop there. We pretend to fake rave for a little bit. We get to the show. I’m feeling pretty good. I had just showered. I was feeling athletic. I had a nice shirt on. There were some cute girls there. I was looking forward to moving past Monica. When we decide to go on, most of the people have left already. It was basically just a show for our friends and the roommates. We go home. We get food and more beer and hang out and watch movies with my projector. I went to bed, crawled up in my loft, and thinking it was one of those rare days when I felt connected to New York. I didn’t feel as isolated as I do most days. We project Blade Runner, for the record."

	//var text = "A day that I remember clear as day started of as any normal day. I went to school, the day went slow and I left super happy to see my boyfriend. It was a nice spring day.I got on the 3 train for a long train ride from harlem all the way down to brooklyn. While getting of the train I proceeded to walk to my boyfriends house(which was about 5blocks).while crossing the street I drop my phone without knowing, I felt like someone was calling me so I turned around and say my phone on the floor. I walked towards it and a man on a bike picked it up.I said thank you thinking he would stop paddling on his bike and hand me my phone but to my surprise he countinued to ride his bike away with my phone. There we're cops in plan view so I waved to them and told them he took my phone. They drove toward him and tried to cut him off but he just paddled around there car so 3 of them got out and tacklied him, hard. All I could think and say was holy shit, this is not happening. They pen him down and he's trying to fight back so they get more aggressive (which I thought wasn't needed but that's cops)they finally got him handcuffed and in the car bleeding and scars all over him. While they were tackling him a crowd surrounded in disguise.the all blamed his treatment on me and started threating me, cursing at me with pure anger. I was just in shock trying to defend myself to people that saw this man try to steal my phone. I didn't argree with how he was treated but he did something wrong. The crowd got so angry the cops had to lock me in the police car while they tried to calm the crowd down(which the didn't)I could do anything but cry, I couldn't talk I just cried. they took me to a preceint to write a report and then they drove me home. Finally in my bed, with my phone and away from a crowd that didn't care about my safety. I thought about a lot of things like maybe its a sign I shouldnt be going out with a man 6/7 years older then me. Maybe I should of been more focused on school....";

	//var text = "On Friday, March 15th I woke up around 11:20AM, to leave for work at around 11:20. I took the 12 bus from Fordham Road to the 4 train on Jerome Ave. I took the 4 train to 59th Street and Lexington Ave. I always fall asleep on the train, and always wake up at my stop or the stop before. It never fails to happen. I have an opening shift at work which passes by fast but mornings are usually very slow. My only thought was that I wanted my shift to finish because I was going to attend a Caribbean concert at the Kimmel Center in NYU. The bakery I work at gets extremely busy during lunch and rush hours. I was just dying to get out of work. I finally clocked out at 8:30PM and immediately running to the employee bathroom to change. I texted my friend to let him know I was on my way. I took the R train, to what I thought was Downtown and ended up traveling Uptown to Queens Plaza. I got off, and took the E train to West 4th. My phone died so I wasn't able to use Google Maps to find out how to get to the Kimmel Center. I always get lost around West 4th. I went around asking people where Washington Square Park was because I knew my way around from there. After walking in circles I finally found my destination and headed to the 4th floor. As I was leaving the elevator I found friends from my University getting out from the other elevator which was a coincidence because we don't go to NYU. I asked her to get my friend because he was holding my ticket. He finally found me with our other friend and took me to put my things away in his Commuter Locker. The concert was just beginning when we got back to the room. A Haitian group played a few songs until the main artist, reggae and dancehall singer Mavado came out. It was my first reggae concert, so it was interesting to see the way people were dancing around me. Because it was a Caribbean concert flags were handed out outside, my friend had a Dominican Republic flag for me. I tied it to the belt holes of my jeans. This boy came up to me saying, Que Lo Que (A supposedly common Dominican phrase) and took me to dance with force. I didn't want to so kindly smiled and said No Thank You. The artist left mid way through a song, and didn't even Thank the Club for the audience for having him which was weird because the organizers didn't even expect it. The DJ played a few songs to finish the concert, and had the MC entertaining us and then my friends and I left. As we were getting our things to leave the school, another boy was hitting on my friend's classmate and she rejected him. He proceeded to say Because of the fag because my friend is gay, and he was with his boyfriend. Both boys got really offended and angrily walked out without causing a scene. It was awkward for me because having negative comments said about you because of your sexuality hurts. I could just imagine how they felt. They were coming over my apartment and walking to the train was silent. I told them to Let it go because it wasn't worth it having people they don't know have so much affect on them. The train ride was fun, I was trying on one of my friends fashion glasses and we were talking about an upcoming conference I'm going to and different events coming up this month. We took the D directly to Fordham Road and walked to a grocery store near my apartment bought milk and oatmeal. We cooked and watched the movie The Collector. I left to go to my room and sleep leaving them on the sofa bed in my living room. I was physically exhausted and went to sleep right away.";
